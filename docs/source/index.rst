ThinkWerke
===========

ThinkWerke is where **strategy meets security** combining regulatory expertise, engineering depth, and implementation experience to help organisations build compliant, resilient, and scalable digital ecosystems.

We bring proven capability across **ISO 27001 implementation**, **EU Compliance & Governance (NIS2, DORA, AI Act, DATA Act, CRA readiness)**, **GRC framework design**, and **DevSecOps enablement** delivering secure-by-design architectures and operational governance that withstand regulatory scrutiny and business change.

Our team has hands-on experience in developing and automating security controls, audit evidence workflows, and CI/CD pipelines, integrating compliance directly into development and operations.  
From **governance and risk assessments** to **technical deployment and reporting automation**, we turn complex regulatory requirements into measurable, operational outcomes.

We are prepared to demonstrate our approach and toolchain in action.  
If your requirements are listed or scoped, **ThinkWerke can provide a live demo** of how NIS2, ISO 27001, and DevSecOps controls align seamlessly within your environment.

By uniting governance, engineering, and automation, ThinkWerke helps businesses **reduce risk, accelerate delivery, and earn lasting customer trust** ensuring that security and compliance become embedded strengths, not external constraints.

Cloud-Native Security and Application Assurance
===============================================

In collaboration with **Security Mind**, ThinkWerke integrates advanced cloud and application security capabilities 
across the full development and operations lifecycle. Our joint approach combines strategy, tooling, and automation to 
deliver continuous compliance, threat visibility, and secure-by-design environments.

**Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform (CNAPP)**  
CNAPP provides unified visibility and protection across workloads, containers, and cloud infrastructure.  
Through this framework, we consolidate CSPM, CWPP, and CIEM capabilities to:

  - Detect and remediate misconfigurations and vulnerabilities across hybrid cloud assets  
  - Enforce least-privilege and identity-based access policies  
  - Integrate runtime security into CI/CD and infrastructure pipelines  
  - Continuously assess compliance against ISO 27001, NIS2, and CRA-aligned controls  

**Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)**  
CSPM ensures that cloud environments remain secure and compliant by design.  
Our implementation approach leverages automated policy checks, drift detection, and guardrails that:

  - Prevent misconfigurations across AWS, Azure, and GCP  
  - Continuously monitor compliance baselines and detect deviations  
  - Provide board-level reporting through real-time dashboards and evidence generation  

**Application Security Posture Management (ASPM)**  
ASPM extends continuous security into the application layer by integrating SAST, DAST, and dependency analysis 
directly into the development workflow.  
Together with Security Mind, we:

  - Correlate findings across code, build, and runtime stages  
  - Prioritize vulnerabilities based on exploitability and business impact  
  - Embed secure-by-default principles into DevSecOps toolchains  
  - Provide traceable evidence for AI Act,
