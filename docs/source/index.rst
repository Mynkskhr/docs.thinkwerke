ThinkWerke
===========

ThinkWerke is where **strategy meets security** combining regulatory expertise, engineering depth, and implementation experience to help organisations build compliant, resilient, and scalable digital ecosystems.

We bring proven capability across **ISO 27001 implementation**, **EU Compliance & Governance (NIS2, DORA, AI Act, DATA Act, CRA readiness)**, **GRC framework design**, and **DevSecOps enablement** delivering secure-by-design architectures and operational governance that withstand regulatory scrutiny and business change.

Our team has hands-on experience in developing and automating **security controls, audit evidence workflows, and CI/CD pipelines**, integrating compliance directly into development and operations.  
From **governance and risk assessments** to **technical deployment and reporting automation**, we turn complex regulatory requirements into measurable, operational outcomes.

We are prepared to demonstrate our approach and toolchain in action.  
If your requirements are listed or scoped, **ThinkWerke can provide a live demo** of how NIS2, ISO 27001, and DevSecOps controls align seamlessly within your environment.

By uniting governance, engineering, and automation, ThinkWerke helps businesses **reduce risk, accelerate delivery, and earn lasting customer trust** ensuring that security and compliance become embedded strengths, not external constraints.
