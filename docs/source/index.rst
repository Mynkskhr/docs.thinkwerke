ThinkWerke
===========

Thinkwerke is a security, cloud, and compliance engineering practice focused on helping European organisations meet rising regulatory expectations while improving the speed, reliability, and security of their technology platforms.

We combine **Security Architecture**, **Cloud Engineering**, **DevSecOps**, and **EU Regulatory Compliance** into one integrated delivery model.  
Our work turns regulations such as **ISO 27001, NIS2, CRA, SOC 2, GDPR, DORA, and the AI Act** into practical, automated, and measurable technical controls.

We do not deliver presentations alone, we deliver **systems, pipelines, evidence, governance, and capability uplift**.

What We Offer
=============

ISO 27001 Programme (8–16 Weeks)
--------------------------------

* Gap assessment, SoA, and risk methodology  
* Internal audit structure and governance  
* Evidence collection workflows  
* Technical control alignment with cloud, CI/CD, identity, and logging  
* Audit-ready artefacts and documentation

**Outcome:** Zero major findings, predictable governance, ready for certification.

NIS2 & CRA Readiness
--------------------

* SSLM (SAST, SCA/SBOM, DAST, IaC, container scanning)  
* Vulnerability lifecycle (detection → triage → SLA → verification)  
* SBOM and OSS License Governance (CRA Annex I & II)  
* Infrastructure security: logging, identity, encryption, segmentation  
* Continuous evidence generation

**Outcome:** Regulation-aligned pipelines, automated audit evidence, and improved tender positioning.

SOC / SIEM Modernisation
------------------------

* Cloud-native SIEM design and deployment  
* MITRE ATT&CK–aligned detection engineering  
* CSIRT processes and response workflows  
* Alert reduction and signal optimisation  
* Compliance dashboards for ISO/NIS2/DORA

**Outcome:** High-visibility operations with measurable security maturity.

CSPM, ASPM, CNAPP & Cloud Governance
------------------------------------

* Multi-account landing zone and governance  
* Identity governance and least privilege  
* CSPM-driven posture management  
* ASPM and CNAPP for cloud-native environments  
* Drift detection, guardrails, and policy-as-code

**Outcome:** Cloud environments that stay compliant and secure at scale.

Secure DevOps & CI/CD Enablement
--------------------------------

* Secure-by-default CI/CD guardrails  
* IaC governance and automated scanning  
* Attestation, provenance, and artefact integrity  
* Deployment safety and rollback controls  
* Developer-friendly processes and guidance

**Outcome:** Faster delivery with built-in governance and security.

How We Deliver Value
====================

Thinkwerke follows a simple principle:  
Compliance must be engineered, automated, and continuously visible, not performed manually once a year or on Cutomer demand, it should always be in "Ready" mode.

We provide:

* Solutions Architecture Development (Security & Cloud)
* Hands-on DevSecOps engineers
* Delivery managers who understand both compliance and engineering
* Process designers who help internal teams adopt sustainable practices
* Interim capability uplift until teams take full ownership

This creates:

* Faster implementation  
* Structured internal skill growth  
* Reduced reliance on external partners  
* Documented, repeatable, measurable controls

We Automate the most Critical KPI's for Business Stakeholders
-------------------------------------------------------------

Every control generates **evidence**:

* Tickets  
* Reports  
* SBOMs  
* Logs  
* Audit trails  
* Configuration snapshots  

We Transfer Knowledge
---------------------

We coach your teams to operate and improve the system without external dependency.
