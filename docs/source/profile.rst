Who I Am
--------

I am a hands-on **Information Security**, **Cloud Security Architect**, and **AWS Solutions Architect** who has evolved into a strategic consultant and executive advisor. With deep engineering experience and a strong GRC foundation, I bridge the gap between business objectives and technical execution, ensuring security is not just compliant but also an accelerator for product growth, customer trust, and market expansion.

I understand how to build and protect systems at the infrastructure level, but more importantly, I know how to translate technical outcomes into business value. Whether working with C-level leadership or engineering teams, I focus on closing gaps across people, process, and technology so organisations can scale securely, pass audits confidently, and deliver products faster without compromising risk posture.

If your organisation needs someone who can design secure architectures, implement controls, assess infrastructure realities, and deliver measurable outcomes, I bring the ability to operate at both hands-on technical depth and board-level strategic height. aligning all stakeholders toward secure, growth-oriented results and providing accurate reports to stakeholders about blockers, whether cultural, knowledge-based, or human factors.

Profile Summary
---------------

Information Security and Cloud Consultant with **12+ years** of global experience delivering secure digital transformation, cloud governance, and regulatory compliance programs for European and global organisations.

I have held full-time roles with **IBM**, **Oracle**, and **OpenText**, building a solid foundation in cloud infrastructure, DevOps, and information security.

Additionally, I have delivered project consulting engagements with **Red Hat** and **Microsoft**, enabling enterprises to secure multi-cloud environments, establish strong governance, and achieve cross-regional regulatory compliance.

I specialise in guiding organisations through complex security transformations — from **zero-trust architecture** and **secure CI/CD pipelines** to **multi-geo compliance programs** aligned with **ISO 27001**, **GDPR**, **CIS Benchmarks**, and **NIST CSF**.

My work integrates governance, automation, and resilience into cloud environments, ensuring risk reduction, audit readiness, and faster delivery without operational friction.
