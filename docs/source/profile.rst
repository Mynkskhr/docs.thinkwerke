I am an Information Security & Cloud Security Architect with **12+ years of experience** across critical infrastructure, regulated industries, and multi-stakeholder environments, with a strong focus on **EU Sovereign Cloud**, **data sovereignty**, and emerging **European Data Space** initiatives. My past work experiences includes impactful engineering roles at **IBM, Oracle, and OpenText**, combined with consulting work at **Red Hat, Microsoft, and AWS partners**.

My strength is the ability to operate across the full lifecycle of modern security and cloud transformation:

* technical architecture
* secure engineering
* GRC (Governance, Risk and Compliance
* executive strategy

I specialise in translating complex EU regulations **NIS2, DORA, GDPR, CRA, EU Data Act, AI Act** and global frameworks such as **ISO 27001, SOC 2, and CSA CCM** into secure-by-design architectures, operational controls, and evidence-driven compliance workflows tailored for European organisations.

I integrate and deliver:

* Cloud Security Architecture (AWS-first, hybrid, sovereign) with GAIA-X and European Data Space principles.
* ISMS governance and EU regulatory engineering for ISO 27001, NIS2, CRA, GDPR, and DORA alignment.
* DevSecOps pipelines with automated validation across SAST, SCA/SBOM, IaC, DAST, and container security.
* Secure Software Lifecycle Management (SSLM) and software supply-chain risk controls.
* Automated CI/CD, artifact integrity, attestation, and evidence-generating workflows.
* CSPM, IAM governance, multi-account security foundations, and continuous cloud posture visibility.
* AWS Solutions Architect Professional–level cloud engineering delivering practical, audit-ready security controls.

I have helped organisations become **audit-ready, secure, competitive, and resilient**, while enabling engineering teams to deliver quickly and confidently under modern EU regulatory requirements.


Whitepapers and Project Developments
-----------------------------------------------------

In my recent work, I authored and designed several security transformation frameworks used by
regulated organisations:

**Secure Software Lifecycle Management (SSLM) Framework**

End-to-end model integrating SAST, SCA/SBOM, API Security, DAST, IaC scanning, container scanning,
and secrets detection mapped directly to **NIS2, CRA, ISO 27001, SOC 2** (Can be extended to DORA and DATA ACT).

Automated Vulnerability Management & Jira Governance
----------------------------------------------------

A unified workflow replacing spreadsheets with automated detection → assignment → SLA tracking
→ evidence and closure.

Open Source Software License Governance
---------------------------------------

Policy covering allowlist/restrictlist/blocklist licensing, SBOM transparency, and supply-chain compliance
under **CRA** and **NIS2**.

Cloud Security Posture & Identity Governance for Nis2/Dora
----------------------------------------------------------

C-level architecture guidance for CSPM/CIEM aligned to EU regulatory expectations, reducing operational
risk and providing measurable assurance.

These frameworks form the basis of **Thinkwerke’s 3–4 week PoC**, demonstrating rapid security
modernisation in regulated environments. **You can request to view it**
