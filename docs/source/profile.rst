Who I Am
========

I am a EU focused Information Security & Cloud Security Architect with **12+ years of experience**
across critical infrastructure, regulated industries, and complex multi-stakeholder
organisations with keen interest on EU Sovereign Cloud Architecture and Development Space.

My strength is the ability to operate seamlessly across the entire spectrum:

* technical architecture
* secure engineering
* governance
* compliance
* executive strategy

I specialise in translating complex EU regulations **NIS2, DORA, GDPR, CRA, EU Data Act, AI Act and also on global frameworks ISO 27001, SOC 2 and CSA CCM** 
into secure-by-design architectures, operational controls, and evidence-driven compliance frameworks.

My work blends:

* AWS Solutions Architect Professional–level cloud engineering
* ISO 27001 governance & audit readiness
* DevSecOps and secure CI/CD automation
* EU regulatory mapping across various industrial domains and cloud platforms
* Software supply-chain security and evidence generation

Profile Summary
===============

Security, Cloud, and Regulatory Consultant with deep experience delivering secure cloud platforms,
sovereign cloud architectures, and compliance-by-design operating models across European Union.

My background includes engineering roles at **IBM, Oracle, OpenText** and consulting engagements with
**Red Hat, Microsoft, and AWS partners**, enabling me to bridge:

* deep technical depth
* secure architectural patterns
* regulatory expectations
* leadership-level business outcomes

I integrate:

* Cloud Security Architecture (AWS-first, hybrid, sovereign)
* GAIA-X & Data Space principles
* ISMS governance & EU regulatory engineering
* DevSecOps pipelines & automated validation
* Secure Software Lifecycle Management (SSLM) frameworks

I help organisations become **audit-ready, secure, and competitive**, without slowing engineering.

Executive Thought Leadership & Whitepaper Projects
==================================================

In my recent work, I authored and designed several security transformation frameworks used by
regulated organisations:

Secure Software Lifecycle Management (SSLM) Framework
-----------------------------------------------------

End-to-end model integrating SAST, SCA/SBOM, API Security, DAST, IaC scanning, container scanning,
and secrets detection — mapped directly to **NIS2, CRA, ISO 27001, SOC 2 (Can be extended to DORA and DATA ACT)**.

Automated Vulnerability Management & Jira Governance
----------------------------------------------------

A unified workflow replacing spreadsheets with automated detection → assignment → SLA tracking
→ evidence and closure.

Open Source Software License Governance
---------------------------------------

Policy covering allowlist/restrictlist/blocklist licensing, SBOM transparency, and supply-chain compliance
under **CRA** and **NIS2**.

Cloud Security Posture & Identity Governance for NIS2/DORA
----------------------------------------------------------

C-level architecture guidance for CSPM/CIEM aligned to EU regulatory expectations, reducing operational
risk and providing measurable assurance.

These frameworks form the basis of **Thinkwerke’s 3–4 week PoC**, demonstrating rapid security
modernisation in regulated environments.

Strategic Accelerators
=========================

* Align cybersecurity, cloud, and regulatory strategy with business outcomes
* Architect secure-by-design platforms with measurable guardrails
