Glossary of Terms
=================

This glossary defines terms as they are used **within Thinkwerke documentation**.
Where industry-standard definitions exist, they are respected; where ambiguity
commonly exists in regulated environments, additional clarification is provided.

The goal is **shared understanding across engineering, security, compliance,
and audit stakeholders**.


Audit-ready evidence
--------------------
Documented, reproducible proof that demonstrates a control is implemented,
operating, and effective. Evidence is generated through systems, workflows,
and logs — not created ad hoc for audits.


CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery)
----------------------------------------------------
Automated pipelines that build, test, validate, and deploy software.
In this documentation, CI/CD pipelines are treated as **control execution
points** and **evidence generators**.


CNAPP (Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform)
----------------------------------------------------
An integrated approach combining CSPM, workload protection, identity visibility,
and runtime security for cloud-native environments, including Kubernetes.


Compliance mapping
------------------
The structured translation of regulatory, standard, or contractual requirements
into technical controls, implementations, and evidence artifacts.


Control
-------
A technical, procedural, or organisational mechanism designed to mitigate
risk or satisfy a regulatory or security requirement.


Control-to-proof
----------------
A traceable relationship between a defined control, its implementation,
and the evidence that proves it is operating as intended.


CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management)
---------------------------------------
Continuous assessment of cloud configurations against security baselines,
regulatory requirements, and organisational policies.


Evidence by design
------------------
An approach where systems and processes are designed to **produce evidence
continuously**, rather than generating documentation manually for audits.


Operating model
---------------
The defined ownership, workflows, escalation paths, and reporting structures
that ensure security controls function consistently across teams and systems.


Shared responsibility
---------------------
The division of security and compliance responsibilities between a cloud
provider and the customer. This documentation focuses on **making customer
responsibilities explicit and provable**.


SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)
------------------------------------------------
A system for collecting, correlating, and analysing security-relevant logs and
events to support detection, investigation, and compliance reporting.


SSLM (Secure Software Lifecycle Management)
-------------------------------------------
An approach to embedding security controls across the full software lifecycle,
including design, development, testing, deployment, and operation.


Supply-chain security
---------------------
Controls and processes that manage risk introduced through third-party software,
open-source dependencies, build systems, and delivery pipelines.


Tender evidence
---------------
Pre-packaged, reusable evidence artifacts used to respond consistently and
accurately to security and compliance sections of procurement processes.


Vendor-hosted environment
-------------------------
Infrastructure or platforms operated by third-party providers (e.g. cloud or
SaaS vendors) where the customer retains defined security responsibilities.


Vulnerability lifecycle
-----------------------
The end-to-end process for identifying, prioritising, remediating, tracking,
and evidencing vulnerabilities, including ownership and SLAs.
