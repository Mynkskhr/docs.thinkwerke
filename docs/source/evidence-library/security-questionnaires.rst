Security Questionnaires
=======================

Purpose
-------

Security questionnaires are a standard requirement in:

- Enterprise sales cycles
- Vendor onboarding
- Customer assurance programs
- Regulatory procurement processes

This page explains how Thinkwerke enables organisations
to answer security questionnaires **quickly, consistently, and defensibly**.

---

Why Questionnaires Become a Bottleneck
--------------------------------------

Security questionnaires typically fail because:

- Questions are interpreted differently each time
- Answers depend on individual contributors
- Evidence is copied manually between submissions
- Responses drift away from actual implementations
- There is no single source of truth

As a result, questionnaires consume excessive time
and introduce risk.

---

Thinkwerke Approach
-------------------

Thinkwerke treats questionnaires as a **view over existing evidence**,
not as standalone documents.

Each answer is:

- Mapped to one or more controls
- Linked to real technical proof
- Reused across customers
- Reviewed and updated centrally

This ensures answers remain accurate and defensible.

---

Questionnaire Structure
-----------------------

Questionnaires are typically organised into domains such as:

- Governance and risk management
- Identity and access management
- Secure software development
- Vulnerability management
- Incident response and monitoring
- Data protection and privacy

Thinkwerke aligns these domains to existing control frameworks.

---

Evidence-Backed Answers
-----------------------

Every answer is supported by:

- Control definitions
- Implementation references
- Links to pipelines, dashboards, or configurations
- Ownership and accountability statements

This allows reviewers to validate claims quickly.

---

Mapping to Standards
--------------------

Security questionnaire responses are commonly mapped to:

- ISO/IEC 27001 controls
- NIS2 obligations
- CRA requirements
- GDPR principles
- Customer-specific frameworks

This enables reuse across regulatory and commercial contexts.

---

Reuse and Consistency
---------------------

Answers are:

- Reused across multiple questionnaires
- Maintained in a central evidence library
- Versioned and time-bound
- Reviewed on a defined cadence

This prevents answer drift over time.

---

Engineering Involvement
-----------------------

Engineering teams are not required
to re-answer questions for each submission.

Their role is limited to:

- Maintaining the underlying controls
- Improving implementations when required

This protects engineering focus.

---

Business Impact
---------------

Organisations using this approach achieve:

- Faster questionnaire turnaround times
- Reduced sales friction
- Increased confidence during customer reviews
- Lower audit and assurance risk

Security assurance becomes predictable and scalable.

---

Relationship to Other Evidence
------------------------------

Security Questionnaires rely on:

- :doc:`control-to-proof`
- :doc:`exportable-artifacts`
- :doc:`tender-packs`

They represent a **consumer-facing projection**
of the Evidence
