Evidence Library
================

Purpose
-------

The Evidence Library documents how Thinkwerke designs, produces,
and maintains **audit-ready, exportable security and compliance evidence**
directly from technical systems and workflows.

The goal is simple:

- Reduce manual compliance work
- Eliminate last-minute audit panic
- Reuse evidence across audits, customers, and tenders

---

What We Mean by "Evidence"
--------------------------

Evidence is not a document written for an auditor.

Evidence is **proof** that a control exists, is operating,
and is owned.

Valid evidence typically includes:

- System-generated records
- Pipeline outputs
- Configuration states
- Workflow histories
- Logged approvals and exceptions

---

Evidence-by-Design Principle
----------------------------

Thinkwerke applies an **Evidence-by-Design** approach:

- Controls are implemented with evidence outputs in mind
- Evidence is produced automatically
- Evidence is verifiable and time-bound
- Evidence maps directly to requirements

This removes the need for retroactive documentation.

---

Evidence Categories
-------------------

The Evidence Library is organised into the following categories:

- Tender & assurance packs
- Security questionnaires
- Control-to-proof mappings
- Exportable artefacts

Each category is designed for a specific stakeholder audience.

---

Evidence Lifecycle
------------------

Evidence follows a clear lifecycle:

1. Control definition
2. Technical implementation
3. Continuous operation
4. Evidence generation
5. Export and reuse
6. Review and retention

This lifecycle ensures consistency across time and audits.

---

Who Uses the Evidence Library
-----------------------------

The Evidence Library supports:

- Internal security and engineering teams
- Auditors and certification bodies
- Regulators and supervisory authorities
- Customers and procurement teams
- Executive and board-level stakeholders

Each audience consumes the same evidence, presented differently.

---

Relationship to Compliance Mapping
----------------------------------

Evidence artefacts are mapped directly to:

- ISO/IEC 27001 controls
- NIS2 obligations
- CRA requirements
- GDPR principles
- Customer-specific requirements

This mapping is documented in the
:doc:`../compliance/crosswalks` section.

---

Automation and Tooling
----------------------

Evidence is typically generated via:

- CI/CD pipelines
- Cloud security tooling
- Ticketing and workflow systems
- Logging and monitoring platforms
- Configuration and policy-as-code

Manual evidence is avoided wherever possible.

---

Design Goals
------------

The Evidence Library is designed to be:

- Reusable across multiple audits
- Consistent over time
- Easy to explain and defend
- Aligned with real system behaviour

If evidence cannot be explained technically,
it is not considered sufficient.

---

Key Takeaway
------------

Strong compliance is built on strong evidence.

The Evidence Library turns everyday engineering activity
into continuous proof of security and compliance.
