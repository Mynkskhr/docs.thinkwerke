How to Use This Documentation
=============================

This documentation is designed to be used by **engineering teams, security
leaders, compliance owners, and auditors** working in regulated or
customer-assessed environments.

It is not marketing material.
It is a **working reference** for architecture, control implementation,
evidence generation, and assurance.


Who this documentation is for
-----------------------------

This documentation is intended for:

- Engineering and platform teams implementing security controls
- Security and compliance teams preparing for audits or customer assurance
- Architects defining cloud and software security foundations
- Leadership teams seeking defensible positions for regulators and customers
- External auditors and assessors reviewing technical evidence


How the documentation is structured
-----------------------------------

The documentation is organised around **execution, not theory**.

Each section serves a distinct purpose:

Start here
^^^^^^^^^^
Orientation material explaining how Thinkwerke approaches security,
compliance, and evidence generation.

Solutions & Architectures
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Concrete implementation patterns for secure software delivery, cloud
security foundations, vulnerability handling, and detection capabilities.

Compliance Mapping
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Translations of regulatory and standard requirements (ISO 27001, NIS2,
CRA, GDPR) into **technical controls and evidence expectations**.

Evidence Library
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Examples of audit-ready artifacts, tender packs, questionnaires, and
control-to-proof mappings used in real engagements.

Whitepapers & Research
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Deeper analysis and guidance for organisations designing long-term
security and compliance strategies.


How to read a page
------------------

Most pages follow a consistent structure:

- **Context** – why the topic exists and where it applies
- **What good looks like** – expected outcomes, not just activities
- **Implementation guidance** – how controls are executed in practice
- **Evidence expectations** – what proof is typically required
- **Common pitfalls** – frequent failure patterns observed in audits


What this documentation is not
------------------------------

To avoid confusion, this documentation deliberately does **not** include:

- Tool-specific vendor marketing
- Generic compliance checklists
- One-size-fits-all policies
- Legal interpretations of regulations

Where tools are referenced, they are used as **examples**, not requirements.


How to use this for audits and tenders
--------------------------------------

These documents can be used directly to:

- Prepare for ISO 27001, NIS2, CRA, or customer audits
- Build internal control and evidence libraries
- Support tender and procurement responses
- Align engineering, security, and compliance teams

However, documentation alone is **not evidence**.
Auditors and customers will expect implementations, logs, workflows, and
traceability behind what is described here.


Living documentation
--------------------

This documentation evolves based on:

- Regulatory changes
- Customer and auditor expectations
- Lessons learned from real implementations

Sections may be expanded, refined, or deprecated over time to reflect
current best practices.


How to engage Thinkwerke
