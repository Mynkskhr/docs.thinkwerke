Compliance Maturity Chain
From NIS2 → EU AI Act → Cyber Resilience Act → ISO 27001 → Customer Trust

NIS2 / AI Act / Data Act / CRA Implementation Focus
---------------------------------------------------

The European digital compliance landscape is evolving rapidly.  
Through a unified framework, I help organizations such as **Diehl Metering** and similar enterprises to:

- Align cybersecurity controls with **NIS2 risk management and reporting obligations**.  
- Integrate **AI Act transparency, fairness, and data governance requirements** into analytics workflows.  
- Operationalize **Data Act mandates** around data access, interoperability, and accountability for 
  data-sharing ecosystems and connected products.  
- Embed **CRA secure-by-design and lifecycle security principles** into software and connected device portfolios.  
- Maintain continuous alignment with **ISO/IEC 27001:2022** to ensure audit-ready documentation, traceability, 
  and sustained improvement.  
- Build governance structures that unify **risk management, data stewardship, product assurance, and executive reporting**.  

This cross-regulatory approach ensures compliance efforts are **strategic, scalable, and verifiable**, 
reducing duplication and creating a resilient foundation for future regulatory evolution.
