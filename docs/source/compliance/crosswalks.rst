Compliance Crosswalks: One Control, Many Obligations
=====================================================

Purpose
-------

This document explains how Thinkwerke reduces compliance overhead by
**mapping a single technical control to multiple regulatory and assurance frameworks**.

Instead of implementing controls separately for each regulation,
we build **shared, evidence-producing controls** that satisfy
multiple obligations simultaneously.

---

Why Crosswalks Matter
---------------------

Organisations operating in EU-regulated environments typically face:

- ISO 27001
- NIS2 Directive
- Cyber Resilience Act (CRA)
- GDPR
- Customer security requirements
- Industry questionnaires and tenders

Without crosswalks, teams duplicate work, create inconsistent controls,
and struggle to explain coverage.

Crosswalks solve this structurally.

---

Thinkwerke Crosswalk Philosophy
-------------------------------

Thinkwerke crosswalks are:

- Control-centric, not document-centric
- Grounded in real implementations
- Evidence-first
- Maintained alongside systems

Each control answers three questions:

1. What requirement does this control satisfy?
2. Where is it implemented technically?
3. What evidence proves it continuously?

---

Core Crosswalk Dimensions
-------------------------

Each crosswalk maps across four dimensions:

- **Regulatory requirement**
- **Technical control**
- **Operational process**
- **Evidence artefact**

This ensures traceability from law to pipeline.

---

Example: Vulnerability Management Crosswalk
--------------------------------------------

A single vulnerability management workflow can satisfy:

- ISO 27001 A.12 / A.8
- NIS2 Article 21 (risk management measures)
- CRA vulnerability handling obligations
- Customer assurance requirements

Mapped elements include:

- Detection tooling
- Severity classification
- SLA enforcement
- Workflow ownership
- Exportable evidence

---

ISO 27001 ↔ NIS2 Crosswalk
--------------------------

Key alignment areas:

- Risk management
- Incident detection and response
- Access control
- Logging and monitoring
- Supplier and service management

Thinkwerke ensures these are implemented once
and mapped cleanly to both frameworks.

---

NIS2 ↔ CRA Crosswalk
--------------------

NIS2 and CRA overlap heavily in:

- Secure software lifecycle (SSLM)
- Vulnerability disclosure and remediation
- Supply-chain security
- Incident handling

Thinkwerke aligns these through:

- CI/CD-integrated controls
- SBOM and dependency governance
- Evidence-producing workflows

---

GDPR ↔ Security Framework Crosswalk
-----------------------------------

GDPR privacy requirements intersect with:

- Access control
- Logging and traceability
- Data minimisation
- Incident detection

Privacy controls are mapped alongside security controls,
ensuring GDPR is enforced technically — not just documented.

Customer & Tender Alignment
---------------------------

Crosswalks extend beyond regulation into:

- Customer questionnaires
- RFP and tender responses
- Partner security assessments

Evidence generated for regulators is reused
for customer assurance with minimal adaptation.

---

Evidence Reuse Model
--------------------

Crosswalks enable:

- One control → many requirements
- One evidence artefact → many stakeholders
- Reduced audit fatigue
- Faster tender responses

This significantly reduces recurring compliance workload.

---

Maintaining Crosswalks Over Time
--------------------------------

Crosswalks are kept current through:

- Change management integration
- Architecture updates
- Pipeline evolution
- Regulatory updates

They are living artefacts, not static spreadsheets.

---

Key Takeaway
------------

Compliance scales when controls are engineered once,
mapped correctly, and proven continuously.

Crosswalks turn regulatory complexity
into a manageable, auditable operating model.
