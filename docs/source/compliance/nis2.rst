NIS2 Directive: Operational Security & Resilience
=================================================

Purpose
-------

This document explains how Thinkwerke translates the **NIS2 Directive**
into **operational security and resilience controls** for organisations
operating in regulated and core industry sectors.

The focus is on execution, accountability, and evidence — not legal interpretation.

---

What NIS2 Changes
-----------------

NIS2 raises expectations in three critical areas:

- Executive accountability
- Operational risk management
- Continuous monitoring and incident handling

Unlike previous directives, NIS2 explicitly expects
security measures to be **implemented, monitored, and demonstrable**.

---

Key Challenges in Practice
--------------------------

Organisations commonly struggle with NIS2 because:

- Requirements are interpreted at policy level only
- Ownership between IT, security, and engineering is unclear
- Monitoring exists but is not tied to response
- Evidence is fragmented across tools and teams
- Executive reporting lacks technical grounding

Thinkwerke addresses these gaps by design.

---

Thinkwerke Interpretation Model
-------------------------------

NIS2 requirements are implemented across four layers:

1. Governance and executive oversight
2. Technical and organisational controls
3. Detection and response operations
4. Continuous evidence and reporting

Each layer must be traceable to the others.

---

Risk Management Measures
------------------------

NIS2 risk management is operationalised through:

- Secure software lifecycle controls
- Vulnerability and patch management workflows
- Cloud security posture and configuration management
- Supplier and supply-chain risk controls

Risk treatment decisions are documented and evidenced.

---

Incident Handling and Reporting
-------------------------------

NIS2 incident expectations are met through:

- Centralised detection (SOC / SIEM)
- Defined escalation and response workflows
- Clear decision points for notification
- Evidence-backed timelines and actions

Incident response is rehearsed, not improvised.

---

Monitoring and Logging
----------------------

NIS2 monitoring is implemented via:

- Cloud-native logging and metrics
- Security detections mapped to threat models
- Alert ownership and response SLAs
- Management dashboards aligned to regulatory expectations

Visibility without response is explicitly avoided.

---

Executive Accountability
------------------------

NIS2 introduces direct accountability at management level.

Thinkwerke supports this by providing:

- Decision-grade dashboards
- Clear control ownership models
- Evidence that supports management attestations
- Traceability between executive decisions and technical controls

---

Evidence and Audit Readiness
----------------------------

NIS2 compliance evidence is produced continuously through:

- Security operations logs
- Incident response records
- Risk treatment documentation
- Control effectiveness monitoring

This enables rapid response to regulator inquiries.

---

Relationship to Other Frameworks
--------------------------------

NIS2 builds on and overlaps with:

- ISO 27001
- Cyber Resilience Act (CRA)
- Sector-specific regulations

Key Takeaway
------------

NIS2 is not a documentation exercise.
It is an **operational resilience requirement**.

Organisations succeed when governance, engineering,
and security operations are aligned and provable.
