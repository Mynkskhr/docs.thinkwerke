Getting Started
===============

Welcome to Thinkwerke Documentation.

This documentation provides **technical, architectural, and operational guidance**
for building, operating, and proving secure and compliant cloud systems in
**regulated EU business environments**.

It is designed for practitioners who need to **implement**, **operate**, and
**evidence** security and compliance not for marketing or high-level positioning.


What this documentation is
--------------------------

This site contains **implementation-focused documentation**, including:

- Reference architectures for secure cloud and software delivery
- Practical implementation guidance for security controls
- Compliance mappings translated into executable technical controls
- Evidence models used for audits, tenders, and customer assurance
- Whitepapers and deep-dive research for regulated environments
- Templates, workflows, and operating models

Everything here is written with the assumption that:

- You operate in a **regulated or high-assurance environment**
- You need **verifiable proof**, not only policy statements
- Security and compliance must work **inside real systems and CI/CD pipelines**


What this documentation is not
------------------------------

This documentation intentionally does **not** contain:

- Marketing content or sales messaging
- General introductions to cybersecurity concepts
- Vendor comparison or product reviews
- Compliance checklists without technical grounding

Who this documentation is for
-----------------------------

This documentation is written for:

- Security Architects and Cloud Architects
- Senior Software and Platform Engineers
- DevSecOps and SRE teams
- Compliance, Risk, and GRC practitioners
- Audit and assurance stakeholders
- Technical leadership supporting regulated business domains

Typical use cases include:

- Designing secure cloud and CI/CD architectures
- Preparing for ISO 27001, NIS2, CRA, GDPR or customer audits
- Building evidence models for tenders and assurance
- Aligning vendor-hosted environments with shared responsibility requirements
- Standardising security operating models across teams


How to use this documentation
-----------------------------

The documentation is structured to support **progressive depth**:

1. **Solutions & Architectures**
   Start here if you need reference designs and system-level patterns.

2. **Compliance Mapping**
   Use these sections to understand how regulatory requirements map to
   technical controls and implementations.

3. **Evidence Library**
   Use this when preparing audits, tenders, or customer security assessments.

4. **Whitepapers & Research**
   Deep dives into regulatory interpretation and engineering approaches.

Each section is designed to stand alone, while remaining consistent with the
overall operating model.


Guiding principles
------------------

All content in this documentation follows these principles:

- **Execution over theory**
  Controls are shown as implemented systems, not abstract requirements.

- **Evidence by design**
  Proof is generated continuously through workflows and pipelines.

- **Clear ownership**
  Responsibilities are explicit across vendors, platforms, and teams.

- **Audit realism**
  Content reflects real-world scrutiny from auditors, regulators, and customers.

- **No tool dependency**
  Patterns are vendor-agnostic unless explicitly stated.


Where to go next
----------------

If you are new to this documentation:

- Start with :doc:`how-to-use-this-docs`
- Review key terminology in :doc:`glossary`
- Explore architectural patterns under :doc:`solutions/index`

If you are preparing for compliance or audits:
